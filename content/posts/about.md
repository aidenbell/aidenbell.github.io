### Contacting me
I live and work in Manchester, UK. You can contact me via email by clicking the address below to reveal it using a Captcha to ensure you are not a bot that wants to send me spam.

**Email is the best way to contact me.** I can not promise other means
of communication will reach me as I am moving often for work.

### Software Development
I currently work as a contract software developer and SCRUM Master primarily
with Python and Django but I also have extensive knowledge and experience with
C, Java, Go, PHP, Javascript and other languages and frameworks.

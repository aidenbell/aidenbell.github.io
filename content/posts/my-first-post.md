I am making this site using Hugo so I can post to the Internet in a way that allows me to control the content
as much as possible. I tend to use Facebook like a personal blog, everything is public and I don't have any
"friends" in my list. It is highly likely nobody ever sees that content, but in any case i'd rather have
_my_ content served initially from a system I control.

Why is this even important? Primarily because I want to tinker. It isn't an idealistic or philosophical
reason against big companies. At the end of the day, Facebook provides a valuable service to many which
is fine. I want to present content in a way I want, and produce something that _works for me_, because I can.
Anyone can publish content instantly, through Facebook, Instagram and a million other ways. This is the
way I am choosing.

I hope to build some small tools to allow me to push content from here to other networks and silos. I might
even flip it on its head and use Facebook to author the content, then pull it in to this site as the
canonical source ... effectively using Facebook's Android app as an authoring frontend. Who knows.

      <description>Contacting me I live and work in Manchester, UK. You can contact me via email by clicking the address below to reveal it using a Captcha to ensure you are not a bot that wants to send me spam.
a...@gmail.com  Email is the best way to contact me. I can not promise other means of communication will reach me as I am moving often for work.
Software Development I currently work as a contract software developer and SCRUM Master primarily with Python and Django but I also have extensive knowledge and experience with C, Java, Go, PHP, Javascript and other languages and frameworks.</description>

      <description>I am making this site using Hugo so I can post to the Internet in a way that allows me to control the content as much as possible. I tend to use Facebook like a personal blog, everything is public and I don&amp;rsquo;t have any &amp;ldquo;friends&amp;rdquo; in my list. It is highly likely nobody ever sees that content, but in any case i&amp;rsquo;d rather have my content served initially from a system I control.</description>
